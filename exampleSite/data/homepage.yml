    image: images/hall.jpg
    designation: Canadian-born author, lecturer, astrologer and mystic
    content: Much has been said of the loneliness of wisdom, and how much the Truth
      seeker becomes a pilgrim wandering from star to star. To the ignorant, the wise
      man is lonely because he abides in distant heights of the mind. But the wise
      man himself does not feel lonely. Wisdom brings him nearer to life; closer to
      the heart of the world than the foolish man can ever be. Bookishness may lead
      to loneliness, and scholarship may end in a battle of beliefs, but the wise
      man gazing off into space sees not an emptiness, but a space full of life, truth,
      and law.

  - name: Carl Jung
    image: images/carl.jpg
    designation: Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst
    content: Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness's
      of other people. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,
      but by making the darkness conscious. The most terrifying thing is to accept
      oneself completely. Your visions will become clear only when you can look into
      your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.
